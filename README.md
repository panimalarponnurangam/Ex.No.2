### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222110031
### NAME : PANIMALAR P
 
### Aim:
To compare the performance, user experience, and response quality of different AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) within a specific use case, such as summarizing text or answering technical questions. Generate a Prompt based output using different Prompting.
### AI Tools required:
- ChatGPT (GPT-4) ->	chat.openai.com
- Claude	claude.ai -> (Anthropic)
- Bard (Gemini) ->	bard.google.com
- Cohere Command R+ ->	cohere.com API access
- Meta LLaMA ->	Open-source via HuggingFace or local deployment

### Methodology
# Platforms Tested: 
ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-4), Claude (Anthropic), Bard (Google Gemini), Cohere Command R+, Meta LLaMA (through open-source deployment or third-party interfaces).

# Prompt Types:
Informative, Creative, Logical Reasoning, Instruction-following, and Conversational.

# Evaluation Metrics:
- Relevance (How closely the output matches the prompt)
- Accuracy (Correctness of information)
- Creativity (Novelty in responses)
- Conciseness (Clear and brief)
- Tone & Coherence (Natural language quality)

# Procedure:
1.Standardized prompts were created across 5 types.
2.Each was entered into all 5 AI platforms.
3.Responses were collected and evaluated by 3 human reviewers using a 1–5 rating scale for each metric.
4.Averages were calculated and compared across models.
